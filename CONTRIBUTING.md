# Contributing

Welcome! For a team of 7, keep the workflow simple and consistent:

- Fork or branch off `main` for features.
- Open a pull request and request at least one reviewer.
- Use descriptive PR titles and link issues.
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` locally before pushing.
- Follow the accessibility checklist in `accessibility.md`.
